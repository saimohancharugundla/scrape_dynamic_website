We generally try to scrape static websites. But coming to dynamic website scraping , its a challenging task.
## The idea of using POSTMAN in scraping dynamic website scraping.
Many geeks go for selenium for scraping Ajax/Javascript call driven websites. It obviously good to go for it and automate the task. 
Postman is a User friendly API testing tool where one can also use to find the internal API implementation of the links in the website. It really helps us in scraping data from Ajax calls driven website.
Observing the rightoeus structure in the Network section of website browser developer tools,we can add the payload or any form-data or any other information what API needs to get the data from server, in the postman API calling section.

This is a small step in using POSTMAN to scrape dynamic website without using **Selenium** and store that data in the MYSQL database.
